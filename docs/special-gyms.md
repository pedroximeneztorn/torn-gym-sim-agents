## Key Insight for Agents

Specialist gyms have higher dots (8.0-10.0) than George's (7.3), but they:
1. Require maintaining stat imbalance (except Sports Science Lab)
2. Cost 25-50 energy per train vs 10 at George's
3. The energy spent building the required imbalance often outweighs the benefit

For most balanced builds, George's (73 dots all stats, 10 energy) is the optimal endgame gym.
