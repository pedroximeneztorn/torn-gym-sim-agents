== Using Happy ==

Happy plays a role in all aspects of the game.

However, it's primarily used or maintained for improved gym gains. Happy significantly impacts gym gains, especially when your stats are at a lower level.

In [[Crimes 1.0]], happiness increased success rates, but the effect wouldn't have been that noticeable. Within [[Crimes 2.0]], happiness increases crime skill and experience gains, not success rates. The exact amount that happiness improves gains has not been revealed.

== Losing Happy ==

With each battle stat train in a gym, you will lose some happy. The amount of happy loss is 40-60% of the energy used per train. Happy loss can be reduced by 50%  with 3* [[Fitness Center]] passive Goal Oriented.

There are also multiple mechanics that may cause a loss of happy.

* Overdosing on drugs like [[Ecstasy]], [[Ketamine]], [[PCP]], [[Shrooms]], [[Speed]], [[Xanax]] will cause your happy bar to be completely emptied.

* If a property's fees build up too much, then after a certain threshold of unpaid fees, the maximum happiness that the property provides will gradually decrease - all the way to 0 over a long period of time.
