<p style="text-align:left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:16px;">The first goal of this guide is to assist all members of the Torn Communtity get a better understanding of how <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> Jumping can help you gain your battle statistics faster and more cost effective than many other methods. (Not to say that it is inheriently cheap when you dive into the extreme end.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:16px;">The second goal is to give you a better understanding of how to execute the various <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> Jumps. In this guide we will go rather in-depth on how to preform one of these jumps alongside the recomended pre-requisites for each method</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:16px;">The third and final goal of this guide is to educate the people of Torn and share some of the knowledge in an easy to digest fourm post. My primary objective of this entire post is to collect as much information as possible from various sources and make a sort of compilation of this knowledge so you have less searching to do. Simple as that. </span></p>

<p><br><span style="font-size:16px;"><br>Most importantly to note, <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> is the Yellow Bar on your screen, if you don't already know this you might want to watch some videos or read up on the game's basics<br><br><span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> Jumping is the act of boosting the gains you get per train in the gym by using Booster Items to increase your <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> bar over its normal maximum set by your property.<br><br><span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> Jumping is merely another method to gaining stats in the gym faster than if you were to use your passive happiness gained from living on your property<br></span><br><strong><span style="font-size:16px;">================================================================</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:32px;"><strong><span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> Jumping - The What and Why</strong></span></div>
<p><br><span style="font-size:16px;"><br>Most of us have the basic understanding that the more <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> you have the more stats you gain per train in the gym, while correct, there is much more to <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> Jumping than just this basic understanding, some of this further knowledge can and will help you get more out of your <span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span><br><br>Your baseline maximum <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> is determined by the property you live in, therefore the higher tier your owned-rented-leased property is the higher your base <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> will be meaning the more you'll get from your training.<br><br>More <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> = More <span style="color:var(--te-text-color-blue);">Stats</span> = More <span style="color:var(--te-text-color-red);">Killing</span><br></span><br><strong><span style="font-size:16px;">================================================================</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:32px;"><strong><span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> Jumping - The Science</strong></span></div>
<p><br><span style="font-size:16px;"><br>The equation of how <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> affects gym gains is also predictable but incredibly complex to figure out. An easier explanation and way of thinking is that the more <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> you have the more stats you gain exponentially, therefore you should train at the gym when you have the maximum amount of <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> within reason. Alternativley, go crazy and spend all your cash on 99K <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> Jumps and be a baller.<br><br>*(Modifiers)*(Gym Dots)*(<span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span> Per Train)*[ (a*ln(<span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span>+b)+c) * (Stat Total) + d*(<span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span>+b) + e ]<br><br>Where a,b,c, & d are constants, estimated values below:<br>a = 3.480061091 x 10^-7<br>b = 250<br>c = 3.091619094 x 10^-6<br>d = 6.82775184551527 x 10^-5<br>e = -0.0301431777<br><br>The simple way to think of it, the higher you boost your <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> the more gains you will get per train at the gym. However, each time you train it lowers your <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> and therefore lowers your gains. The equasion is as simple as can be. You lose roughly 40-60% in <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> compared to the <span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span> spent on training.<br><br>(<span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span> Per Train)*(40-60%) = <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> Loss <br><br>The best way to think about it is that you should never train when low on <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span>, while you might not care about the math of calculating how much your gains are affected but just know that the math is EXPONENTIAL, therefore, the more <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> you have, the following gains are not directly proportional but rather exponential. Similar to how decibel measurements work, doubling your <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> does not result in double the gym gains, it results in more than double the gym gains per <span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span> spent.<br></span><br><strong><span style="font-size:16px;">================================================================</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:32px;"><strong><span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> Jumping - Setup is Everything</strong></span></div>
<p><br><span style="font-size:16px;"><br>The 15-minute Reset - The clock at the top right of your screen is going to be used to time when you boost your <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span>. If you go over the maximum <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> allowed by your property it will reset back to the property maximum allowed at XX:00:00, XX:15:00, XX:30:00, and XX:45:00. You should always start taking your <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> boosting items right after one of these increments.<br><br>Be careful to watch out for this as if you poorly time when you boost your happiness it could reset prematurely and you'd lose your extra <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span>, effectively losing the money you spend on your method of boosting <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> and forcing you to wait out whatever cooldown timer you have accumulated to repeat the <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> gain method.<br><br><span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> jumps rely on your property, you should have at least the following property to do each of the following jumps:<br><br><strong>Lollipop Jumping</strong> - Shack (No Requirements)<br><strong>Big Choco Jumping</strong> - Mansion (Max Upgrades - No Staff)<br><strong>5x EDVD Jumping</strong> - Private Island (Max Upgrades - No Staff)<br><strong>99k EDVD Jumping</strong> - Private Island (Max Upgrades - Max Staff)<br><strong>99k Poison Mistletoe</strong> Jumping - Private Island (Max Upgrades - No Staff)<br><br>This is the subject of opinion but is generally what you should be living at before completing each of the jumps, the higher your property's maximum <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> the more gains you will see from the jumps since it also adds to your total <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> when taking Ecstacy<br><br>When moving on to more costly methods of Jumping (5 and 9 EDVD Methods) it is advised that you pick yourself up a job at a 10-Star Adult Novelties Shop, working at one of these shops doubles the gain in <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> you receive from EDVDs, going from 2500 <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> per EDVD to 5000 <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> per EDVD, this results in major gains compared to jumping without working at a 10 Star AN<br></span><br><strong><span style="font-size:16px;">================================================================</span></strong></p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><strong>Big Choco Jumping - $1,400,000 - $5,100,000</strong></span></div>
<p><br><span style="font-size:16px;"><br><strong>Items Needed:</strong><br>1-4 "Xanax" (See methods below)<br>49 - "Big Box of Chocolate Bars"<br>1 - "Ecstacy"<br>25 Points (Only recomended for "4 Xanax" Jump)<br><br><strong>Steps - 1 Xanax Method:</strong><br>1.

Use your <span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span> to train in a gym<br><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>The "1 Xanax" Jump is intended for those who can only afford a minimal amount of training and are looking for a cheap way to boost their gains in the gym without breaking the bank. This can be done daily if you so choose but be sure to realize your gains could more than likely be the same if you invested in a bigger property.<br><br>The "4 Xanax" Jump is for those looking to gain as much as possible without spending over $6,000,000 per jump. This is for those of you wanting to gain faster but without holding yourself back because of money costs associated with EDVD jumping. This jump can be done every other day but is still effective as a weekly jump for those not looking to, again, break the bank.<br><br>In the "4 Xanax" Jump it is optional to spend the 25 Points on an <span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span> refill but is advised if you wish to make the most of your <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span>.<br><br>This Method of jumping is excellent for an early game player who has just discovered a good way to earn some cash. However, doing EDVD jumps is more cost-effective following the equation used to calculate your gains per <span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span> spent. So it is usually advised you save up some cash and do a 5x EDVD jump instead of a "4 Xanax" Choco Jump or stick to the "1 Xanax" method while saving money. (This is a subject of semi-opnion, if you earn big feel free to spend away, however DVD Jumps can be ultra beneficial if you're chasing that stat dragon)<br></span><br><strong><span style="font-size:16px;">================================================================</span></strong></p>

Use your <span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span> to train in a gym<br><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>This method is best utilized when working at a 10* AN (Adult Novelties Shop) since it doubles your gains from EDVDs. This method is not for those relying on passive income, spending $21 Million is no small feat but this is by far the most effective method to gain <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> as fast as possible independently without extensive effort or help from others. ================================================================<br></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;">14. Repeat Steps 11-13 Until Book is Done</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span><br><span style="font-size:16px;">This method can be done cheaper by using fewer EDVDs and stacking your Ecstacy to exponentially grow your <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> until you get to 99k, just use ecstasy in place of a ton of EDVDs. However, you should only use your book and do this method if you have the cash to supply the Ecstacy</span><br><br><span style="font-size:16px;">Don't waste your book if you can't afford to supply yourself with this many Xanax, if you get lucky with Xanax timers and don't overdose you'll spend over $100 Million on Xanax, it is highly recommended you are in a faction that has a high overdose reduction as every time you overdose you'll have to spend the $32 Million to stack back up to 99k <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span>.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:16px;">Alternative Method Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">This is the way to go if you don't want to spend upwards of a gajillion dollars over the course of a month. Take into account that your gains will be astronomically lower than if you spent all the cash. My advise is to save up and wait until you can afford the more expensive method of utilizing Xanax and Points Shop <span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span> Bar Refills.</span></p>

This is when another person will do the same to you taking half of your Energy they can do the same (See below for how and why)<br><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>This method is usually offered by people doing "<span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> Jump Services". The "Poison Mistletoe" takes 25% of targets <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> away and gives it to you. The steps for this once you use the "Poison Mistletoe" should be done as fast as possible so the next person behind you can do it the same way you did. This method is constrained by the people in the "chain" as maximum <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> will be reset to base at the 15 Minute Increments, so this method is limited by the speed at which you can take the <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> and Train in the gym. This also allows you to use <span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span> drinks to boost your <span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span> after you've used your points to gain the maximum possible stats, this is because you don't have to use any Boosters to gain the <span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span>, therefore allowing you to use <span style="color:#37b24d;">Energy</span> boosters since you don't need to gain any <span style="color:#f59f00;">Happy</span> outside of the Ecstacy which is a Drug, not a Booster. <br><br>Your "Director" or "Service Provider" will usually give you details on how to maximize your gains when doing this method. Check the trade forums for people offering these services, they are expensive but worth it if money isn't an object. These services usually come at the cost of EDVDs to the "Service Provider" <br></span><br><strong><span style="font-size:16px;">================================================================</span></strong></p>

This guide is focused on gaining stats at its core, this guide is not meant as the end all be all of gaining stats but provides a significant amount of detail into how you can gain stats through the primary methods enacted by the Torn Community. There are more than double the methods I've listed here that will work for gaining stats with Happy but these are the primary ones that you will see in use by people across Torn. 

This guide is also not designed to teach you how to get the "Ecstatic" Merit, although the last two methods in this guide will gain you this merit. There are numerous other ways to gain this merit which are covered in other guides. Links Below

I'm only one person armed with the internet and some forum posts, some of the information in here might be wrong or misworded. Go easy I'm a person too. :)

Donations of Xanax, EDVDs, and Poison Mistletoe are always appreciated but never expected.
