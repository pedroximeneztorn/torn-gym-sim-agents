# Goal

Create a codebase that allows an AI agent (like Claude) to make quick simulations about a player's progress in the game Torn.

The codebase should have:
- **Pre-built code** for gym stat calculations
- **Documentation** that an agent can quickly navigate to understand the mechanics

When an agent is loaded into this directory, they should be able to:
1. Quickly understand how gym training works in Torn
2. Build custom simulations on-the-fly based on user questions
3. Calculate stat gains given player stats, happiness, gym choice, and perks
